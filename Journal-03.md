#Learning Journal 3

This has been a great experience, I am still really enjoying this magical ride!
We have started with express and Mongo DB. I am still trying to wrap my head around the
tests. I am finding it is getting easier with each day, although the work load is still
heavy. The TA have been very helpful. Scott is an awesome teacher!
