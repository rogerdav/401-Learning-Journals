# Learning Journal 2

This last week has been tough, the volume of work has been insane. I am still  
I am still really enjoying the challenges although I am finding that the more tired I   
am the harder it is to take in new material.
I enjoy the material we are learning (server side). Scott and the TA have been great  
at explaining the concepts that we are learning, I am just getting frustrated with  
making stupid mistakes that are sometimes taking too long to solve.
